# Mood Tracker

###### Made for the Railway YSWS by Hack Club

## What my project does

This is a web app made with Ruby on Rails. Users can enter their emotions and notes about their day daily to help them reflect on their feelings over time. Users can also edit and delete their entries. 

## Why I made this project

I have absolutely no experience in Ruby, so I thought this YSWS would be a great way to learn more about it. I have been wanting to make a mood tracker, since it seemed like a cool idea, so it seemed like a good project idea for this.

## How I made this project

I used rails for the backend and routing, while using erb and vanilla CSS to make the frontend. I deployed this project to Render.

## What I struggled with

I was struggling with understanding the code since I hadn't had any exposure to Ruby before. I was also confused about how to deploy the Rails app, since I haven't done anything like that before.

## What I learned

I learned basic Ruby on Rails to make a simple functioning app. I also learned the process of deploying on Render, which will be useful for future projects.
